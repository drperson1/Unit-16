          <h2>Correlation Between Poverty and Obesity</h2>
          <p>This is the first article in a series of articles exploring healthcare risks facing various demographic populations in the United States. The scatter plot above shows the correlation between poverty and obesity where each circle
            represents a state.</p>

          <p>As can be seen in the scatter plot, there is a positive correlation between poverty and obesity.  In other words, one can
             expect that the higher the percent of poverty in a state, the higher the percent of obesity in that state's population.
             The state with largest percent of its population in poverty is Mississippi at 25.5%.  Mississippi also has the largest
            obesity percent at 35.5% compared to any other state in the United States.</p>

          <p>The state with the lowest percent of its population in poverty is New Hampshire at 9.2% and although the obesity percent is not the  lowest amongst the states, it
              is certainly lower than that of Mississipi. The state with the lowest obesity percent is Colorado at 21.3%. The percent of Colorado in poverty 
            at 12% percent is not the lowest, but it is still low relative to the majority of the other states. While there are a few outliers,
            we can conclude that the percent of poverty and obesity in a given state are correlated.</p>
